I want to build an NLP ETL data pipeline using PySpark with the following modules: 

1. Configuration module: one common Python configuration file and multiple Python configuration files for each data source system (file, RDBMS, Hive, NoSQL, vector database), preprocessing, chunking, embedding and data target system (file, RDBMS, Hive, NoSQL, vector database), then create one configuration manager to combine various configurations based on specific type. All the configration files should python class based, it should not use json based config file, yaml(.yml) based config file, .conf based config file. It should be purely python class based configuration files for all the configurations.

2. Data source module: read the data from multiple data stores/databases like 1. hive table, 2. HDFS and local file source system (text file, HTML file, JSON file), 3. RDBMS table source, 4. NoSQL source (MongoDB collection), 5. vector database source (ChromDB vector database, PostgreSQL vector database, Neo4j vector database),

3. Preprocessing module: HTML parsing, data cleaning,

4. chunking module: multiple chunking strategies with a chunk smoothing process,

5. vector embedding creation or generation module: tfidf embedding creation, sentence embedding creation,

6. Target module for structured or relational data and vector embedding: Write the data to multiple data stores/databases like 1. Hive table, 2. HDFS and local file target system (text file, HTML file, JSON file), 3. RDBMS table target system, 4. NoSQL target system (MongoDB collection), 5. Vector database target system (ChromDB vector database, PostgreSQL vector database, Neo4j vector database). The target module should have support for 1. full data load, 2. incremental data load.with SCD Type 2 approach and 3. incremental data load.with CDC approach

7. logging module,

8. exception handling module,

9. Very important to note, design a NLP ETL data pipeline such that it can be easily configured and executed with one module or multiple modules like data sources, preprocessing steps, chunking strategies, embedding methods, and target systems without modifying existing code. 

10. Very important to note, design a NLP ETL data pipeline such that each module input read from specific intermediate persisted data source system and write module output to specific intermediate target system.

11. Write a test case for each module code using pytest python framework.

12. Create a project structure for all the above modules.

13. Create a requirements.txt with required Python packages.

14. Create a README.md file with project structure for all the above modules and step-by-step instructions on how to integrate all these files.

All the above modules should be implemented using only these. 1. Singleton Pattern, 2. Factory Pattern, 3. Strategy Pattern, 4. Template Method Pattern, 5. Builder Pattern. Do not use other design patterns than these five. Please generate complete code for all the modules in PySpark only.

NoSQL source (MongoDB collection), 5. vector database source (ChromDB vector database, PostgreSQL vector database, Neo4j vector database). The source module should have support for 1. extract data based on one or multiple tables and then perform some join operations, 2. extract data based on one or multiple queries and form dataframes, then perform join operations if reuired.

3. Preprocessing module: HTML parsing, data cleaning,

4. chunking module: multiple chunking strategies with a chunk smoothing process,

5. vector embedding creation or generation module: tfidf embedding creation, sentence embedding creation,

13. Create a requirements.txt with required Python packages.

14. Create a README.md file with project structure for all the above modules and step-by-step instructions on how to integrate all these files.

15. We should be to create different types of NLP ETL data pipeline from the base NLP ETL data pipeline based domain type like ADMIN, HR, FINANCE and IT HELPDESK.  

All the above modules should be implemented using only these. 1. Singleton Pattern, 2. Factory Pattern, 3. Strategy Pattern, 4. Template Method Pattern, 5. Builder Pattern. Do not use other design patterns than these five. Please generate complete code for all the modules in PySpark only.
